This is an ancient, but useful, program to compute the MD5 hash of one
or more files, specified in one of several ways.  It has been done better
now with standard utilities.

This is used by canlink, so I keep it around as is.

Looks like it was originally checked in to source control (probably RCS)
on 1993-01-17 and has had few changes since.
